## Version 0.13 (March 28, 2011)

_New features_

  - New `Volume` monitor displaying ALSA soundcards information, by
    Thomas Tuegel.
  - New `ThermalZone` plugin substituting `Thermal` and using linux's
    *sysfs* interface (you need this one if you're using a kernel
    version equal to or above 2.6.37). See [issue 44].
  - xmobar app new has WM_CLASS, WM_NAME and _NET_WM_PID xprops
    ([issue 38]).

_Incompatible changes_

  - In the process of solving [issue 14], we've broken those
    configurations that rely on including alignment separators in the
    input fed to `StdinReader`.
  - The MPD plugin does not accept host and port options anymore: use
    the environment variables MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT instead.
  - The `Mail` plugin now takes a second parameter (a string)
    specifying its alias. As a side-effect, this solves [issue 30].

_Bug fixes_

  - [issue 14]: `StdinReader` and other plugins accepting external
    input don't get confused anymore when characters from `alignSep`
    appear in their input.
  - [issue 27]: `BottomSize` placement now respects its width argument.
  - [issue 28]: Compilation in Mac OS X fixed.
  - [issue 30]: `Mail` plugin can be specified anywhere in commands list.
  - [issue 36]: Battery monitor now supports non-standard locations of
    the `/sys/class/power_supply/AC/online` file.
  - [issue 40]: Battery monitor now supports the new power_now, that
    replaces current_now in linux kernels for v. 2.36 and above.
  - [issue 42]: More accurate net monitor rates.
  - DiskIO, Cpu and MultiCpu monitors are also more accurate now.
  - Text is now correctly centered vertically.
  - `FullBM` border spec fixed.

## Version 0.12 (Dec 24, 2010)

xmobar has a new [maintainer], a new [website], a new [mailing
list] and uses a new [source code repository].

Many thanks to Andrea Rossato, xmobar's author and maintainer so far,
for creating xmobar in the first place, and for giving me the chance
to become its maintainer. And a big thanks to Ben Boeckel, Petr Rockai
and Norbert Zeh for their patches.

_New features_

  - Window borders: configuration options `border` and `borderColor`
    allow drawing borders around xmobar's window.
  - New monitor, `Uptime`, showing the system uptime.
  - New monitor argument (`-S`) to enable displaying the `%` symbol in
    percentages or other suffixes (e.g., units in Uptime and Network);
    the symbol is now never included by default.
  - New 'run once' commands, by specifying a 0 refresh rate in `Run
    Com` ([issue 26]).
  - MPD monitor: updated to libmpd 1.5. New fields `ppos` (playlist
    position) and `remaining` (remaining time). New configuration
    options to specify MPD's host, user name and password.
  - Battery monitor: new `watts` and `timeleft` fields (Petr Rockai),
    and specific arguments to control coloring and thresholds of the
    former.
  - MultiCPU monitor: new `auto*` fields that automatically detect all
    present CPUs (Ben Boeckel).
  - CpuFreq monitor uses just one decimal digit for GHz values (Petr
    Rockai).
  - Mail plugin expands paths starting with "~/" (Ben Boeckel). Ditto
    MBox.
  - Weather monitor now skips not retrieved fields, instead of
    displaying a long error message.
  - New compilation flag, `all_extensions`.
  - Documentation and website updates.

_Bug fixes_

  - [issue 23]: Wireless monitor is now compatible with iwlib 29.
  - [issue 24]: Swap monitor's used ratio display fixed.
  - [issue 25]: Percentages only include `%` if requested using `-P`.
  - [issue 31]: MPD monitor now respects `-W` argument.
  - Fixes in CPU frequency formatting, string alignment and colour
    boxes in monitors (Norbert Zeh).
  - TopMem and TopProc now use the `-L` and `-H` options correctly for
    memory template fields.
  - MBox skips non-existent mbox paths instead of hanging.
